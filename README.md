# Swiftnet
Swiftnet implemented by tensorflow
## Paper
The code is impledmented according to the following papers.
+ [In Defense of Pre-trained ImageNet Architectures for Real-time Semantic Segmentation of Road-driving Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08469.pdf )
## Main Dependencies
```
tensorflow 1.12
Open CV
Python 3.6.5
```
## Note
In the future, I will update the demo code for change version of swiftnet which possess a higher IoU. The pre-trained parameters of ResNet-18 is on https://pan.baidu.com/s/16OjEC-GcWvGIj0eWVe9RiQ.
